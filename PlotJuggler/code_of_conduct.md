# About this project

- PlotJuggler is an open source project that welcomes any user and contributor who is respectful with others.

- No discrimination based on race, sex, gender, religion, nationality and political affiliation is tolerated.

- Please be kind and respectful with others. Being (supposedly) right doesn't give you the right to be an asshole.

- No harassment or bullying. Just... don't be an asshole.

- Any contribution is really, really appreciated. You took the time to make things better, and that is great.
 But as a developer, I am not supposed to accept contributions that are not aligned with the vision of
 the software or have a lower quality than expected.

- Please value the time of the developer(s). Make your issues / feature request as detailed as possible.
  Always provide a simple way to reproduce the issue, when possible.
